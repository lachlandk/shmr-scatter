# SHMR Scatter
These are notebooks from an (ongoing) summer research project in 2023 into the origin of scatter in the galaxy stellar mass-halo mass relationship (SHMR), specifically in the [IllustrisTNG](https://www.tng-project.org/) hydrodynamical simulation.
The project is undertaken at the [University of St Andrews](https://astronomy.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/research/galaxies-evolution/) under the supervision of [Dr Rita Tojeiro](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/people/rmftr).
